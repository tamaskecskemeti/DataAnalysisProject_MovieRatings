# Movie Ratings analysis: Project overview
* The initial question is if someone is planning on going out to see a movie, how well can he/she trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company is showing the rating and also makes money by selling the movie tickets. Do they have any bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?
* Pre-cleaned data was used in order to analyze this problem
* Data manipulation and data wrangling was used with packages like numpy and pandas
* Data visualization was made to easily get insight of the data using matplotlib and seaborn

The initial problem came from: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/ 
The data can be accessed on 538's github: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data.

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.10.4  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Conclusion
The data analytics clearly showed that movies on the Fandango site usually have higher rating than on any other site. This can happen in order to sell more tickets on the website.
